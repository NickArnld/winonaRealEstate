        <p class="para">
            I have lived long enough to see some tremendous changes in the makeup of the Winona community; 
            this has allowed me to give my clients an excellent advantage when it comes to expectations throughout 
            the entire process of buying or selling. I established myself in so many different roles from 
            daughter, wife, and parent, to volunteer prior to becoming a full-time Realtor. 
            I understand that in order to achieve the ultimate goal of homeownership, 
            you need a true professional representing you. 
        </p>  
        <p class="para">
            Homeownership can become very stressful 
            without the proper guidance, so I ensure my clients are as comfortable as 
            possible when going through the process 
            from start to finish.
            Although I focus on the Winona area, I proudly serve the entire state of Minnesota to suit my clients’ 
            needs. I chose to become a realtor because of my true passion for helping others achieve goals they never 
            thought possible. Communication is key, and making my clients comfortable throughout the process of 
            home ownership is my goal.

        <p class="para">
            Understanding today’s consumer is a specialty of mine, as I adapt to the communication methods 
            of my clients and pride myself on having quick response times. I put a major focus on negotiating skills 
            coupled with a game plan to ensure you are either getting top dollar when selling your home or your offer 
            accepted when buying. These are the systems you need in place to fully support the unique audience that 
            must be engaged, especially when dealing with the ever changing market.
